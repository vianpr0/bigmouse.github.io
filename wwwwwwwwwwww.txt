git fetch origin master
git merge origin master
After to wrote this code I received other error: (non-fast-forward)

I write this code:

git fetch origin master:tmp
git rebase tmp
git push origin HEAD:master
git branch -D tmp

pull is always the right approach but one exception could be when you are trying to convert a none-Git file system to a Github repository. There you would have to force the first commit in.

git init
git add README.md
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/userName/repoName.git
git push --force origin master

Try this git command

git push origin master --force
or short of force -f

git push origin master -f
